# Double Push Data Manipulation Assessement

To qualify for an interview, please take the coding challenge:

Before you proceed, ensure you are timing yourself. Do not read or study the assessment questions 

before you begin. This is an open-book assessment. 
 
(ensure you are timing yourself before you begin)
Exercise:
 
Create an application that will prompt for a user to input a string. Using the user’s inputted 

string, find the first letter that is not repeated. 
 
For example: If given the string ‘Bubble’, the letter ‘u’ would be the first character returned from 

the program. Once the first character is found and displayed back to the user, rewrite the string in 

order of number of occurrences and order from the inputted string. In the above example ‘Bubble’ 

would then be rewritten as ‘uleBbb’. Display this to the user.
